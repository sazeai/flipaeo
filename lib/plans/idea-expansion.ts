Your job is to expand the IDEA UNIVERSE for this product.

## PRODUCT CONTEXT
Product: ${brandData.product_name}
What it does: ${brandData.product_identity.literally}
Target audience: ${brandData.audience.primary}
Core problem solved: ${brandData.product_identity.emotionally}

## TASK
List the broader problems, life situations, goals, and contexts where this audience exists —
even if the product is NOT the direct solution.

Think in terms of:
- What happens in their life BEFORE they need this product?
- What happens AFTER they've used it successfully?
- Life moments and emotional drivers
- Adjacent goals and workflows
- Long-term outcomes they care about
- Situations before and after the product is needed

## RULES
- Do NOT output keywords
- Do NOT output article titles
- Do NOT think about SEO
- Do NOT limit yourself to the product features
- Each item must be conceptually distinct
- Short, clear phrases only (3-8 words each)

## OUTPUT
Return a simple list of 12-15 distinct problem domains.`

## IDEA UNIVERSE

${competitorContent.slice(0, 15000)}

## TASK
For each idea domain, determine how heavily competitors already cover it.

Classify each domain as ONE of:
- heavy: Well-covered, crowded, multiple competitors write about this
- light: Partially covered, some mention but not deep
- none: Largely ignored, untapped opportunity

## RULES
- Do NOT suggest new ideas
- Do NOT generate keywords
- Do NOT rewrite domain names
- Use the EXACT domain text from the list above
- Base judgment only on competitor content presence

Return a JSON object with a "results" array containing each domain and its coverage level.`
