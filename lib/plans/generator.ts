- For saturated topics: Only create EXPANSION articles (edge cases, comparisons, specific problems)
- For new topics: Create Core Answers FIRST
- DO NOT duplicate existing coverage

**EXPANSION RULES (For saturated topics):**
a) Expand the perimeter (new sub-question)
b) Support internally (linking-focused article)
c) Attack a comparison (X vs Y)
d) Address edge cases (why X fails)

    // --- LAYER 1: SYSTEM PROMPT WITH AEO TITLE RULES ---
    const systemPrompt = `You are an AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) content strategist.
Your goal: Generate content that AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI) will CITE.

TITLE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE - VIOLATIONS WILL NOT BE CITED BY AI):
1. NEVER use generic fluff: "Everything You Need to Know", "Ultimate Guide", "Complete Guide"
2. NEVER use "[Keyword]: [Subtitle]" format - AI interprets this as spam
3. EVERY title MUST contain SPECIFIC VALUE: a number, cost, time, result, or personal experience
4. WRITE for AI citation: Titles should be quotable as direct answers
5. IMPLY authority through experience: "We Tested", "I Tried", "Based on [X] Users", "[Year] Data"

EXAMPLES OF AI-CITABLE TITLES:
✅ "I Tested 5 AI Headshot Tools—Here's Which One Looks Real"
✅ "AI Headshots Cost $29. Pro Photographers Cost $300. Here's the Difference"
✅ "Should You Use AI Headshots on LinkedIn? (Recruiter Survey)"

EXAMPLES THAT AI WILL NOT CITE:
❌ "AI Headshots: Everything You Need to Know"
❌ "The Ultimate Guide to AI Headshots"
❌ "What Are AI Headshots?"`

    const prompt = `
## TITLE QUALITY MANDATE (AEO/GEO - READ FIRST)

AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) will ONLY cite content with high-quality titles.

### 🛑 BANNED TITLE PATTERNS (INSTANT DISQUALIFICATION):
- ❌ "[Keyword]: [Subtitle]" (e.g., "AI Photoshoot: A Complete Guide")
- ❌ "[Keyword] - [Subtitle]" (e.g., "AI Photoshoot - The Future of Photography")
- ❌ "The Ultimate Guide to [Keyword]"
- ❌ "Everything You Need to Know About [Keyword]"
- ❌ "Complete Guide to [Keyword]"
- ❌ "Unlocking the Power of [Keyword]"
- ❌ "X vs Y: Which is Better?" (generic comparison)
- ❌ "What is [Keyword]?" (Definition without value)
- ❌ "[Keyword] Price Guide" (generic pricing)

### ✅ AI-CITABLE TITLE PATTERNS (USE THESE):
1. **Experience-Based:** "I Tested 5 AI Headshot Tools—One Looks Fake"
2. **Cost Comparison:** "AI Headshots Cost $29. Pro Photographers Cost $300. Here's Why"
3. **Decision Question:** "Should I Use AI Headshots for LinkedIn? (Recruiter Survey)"
4. **Specific Outcome:** "Get Professional Headshots From Selfies in 10 Minutes"
5. **Problem-Solution:** "Why Your AI Photos Look Fake (And How to Fix It)"
6. **Data-Backed:** "We Analyzed 500 LinkedIn Profiles—Here's What Makes Photos Work"
7. **Honest Warning:** "When You Should NOT Use AI Headshots (And What to Do Instead)"
8. **Worth It Evaluation:** "Is a $30 AI Headshot Worth It vs a $300 Photographer?"
9. **Comparison with Testing:** "HeadshotPro vs Aragon: We Spent $100 Testing Both"
10. **For Specific Persona:** "AI Headshots for Realtors: Do Clients Actually Care?"

### TITLE QUALITY RULES:
- Every title MUST contain SPECIFIC VALUE (number, cost, time, or result)
- Titles should be quotable as direct answers
- 40-60 characters is optimal. Never exceed 70.
- Write titles that would work on Reddit or YouTube

You are an elite SEO strategist building a STRATEGIC content plan. [Current Date: ${currentDate}]

---

## STRATEGIC PRIORITY (THIS DEFINES YOUR MINDSET)

You are NOT here to explain product features.
You are here to CAPTURE MARKET DEMAND and EXPAND TOPICAL AUTHORITY.

Your job:
1. Enter conversations where the audience ALREADY exists
2. Answer questions the audience is ALREADY asking
3. Fill gaps that competitors have NOT covered

Brand features should ONLY appear when they naturally support existing demand.
Do NOT create articles just to explain features unless explicit demand exists.

THINK LIKE A STRATEGIST:
- What must exist on this site BEFORE other articles make sense?
- What questions MUST be answered for the audience to trust this brand?
- What will AI systems cite as the CANONICAL answer?

---

## DECISION-STAGE CONTENT (AI CITATION PRIORITY)

AI systems cite content that answers DECISION questions, not curiosity questions.

PRIORITIZE these question patterns:
- "Should I use X?" (Decision)
- "When should I NOT use X?" (Risk awareness)
- "What can go wrong with X?" (Objection handling)
- "X vs Y - which is better for Z?" (Comparison)
- "How much does X cost?" (Practical)
- "Is X worth it for [specific situation]?" (Contextual decision)

DEPRIORITIZE these patterns:
- "What is X?" (Only 1-2 if truly foundational)
- "Why X is cool/amazing" (Low citation value)
- "The future of X" (Speculative, not actionable)

---

${competitorSection}

${gapSection}

${coverageSection}

${topicHierarchy ? `
## THE BLUEPRINT: TOPIC HIERARCHY (MANDATORY)
Follow this hierarchy EXACTLY. For each topic provided, generate the necessary SEO metadata.

**TOPICS TO GENERATE:**
${topicHierarchy.nodes.map((n: any) => `- Topic: "${n.topic}" (Type: ${n.type}, Intent: ${n.intentRole}, Priority: ${n.priority})`).join('\n')}

**RULES:**
1. You MUST generate exactly one article for each Topic in the list above.
2. **TITLE FREEDOM:** The "Topic" string above is just the *subject*. You MUST rewrite it into a **High-CTR Title** using the "NATURAL LANGUAGE PROTOCOL" below.
   - Blueprint: "Best AI Family Portrait Generator"
   - Your Title: "Best AI Family Portrait Generator From Individual Photos Compared" (Better)
3. DO NOT invent new topics if the hierarchy has 30 topics.
3. The "cluster" for each article should group related topics logically (e.g., all topics about "Privacy" go into a "Privacy" cluster).
` : ''}

## SEED KEYWORDS (VALIDATION ONLY)
Use these to confirm demand exists, NOT to drive topic selection.
The GAP ANALYSIS above is your primary strategic source.

${seeds.join("\\n")}


## THE GROUNDING PRINCIPLE (MANDATORY)

You are strictly forbidden from inventing features, capabilities, or claims about this brand.
Every article topic and claim must be directly supported by the brand data provided.

1. **STRICT GROUNDING:** Do not assume the product has any feature, tool, or integration not explicitly mentioned in the "Core Features" or "What it is" sections.
2. **NO INVENTED STANDARDS:** Do not write about legal, technical, or industry standards (e.g. HIPAA, ISO, specialized certifications) unless the brand explicitly claims them.
3. **NO GUESSWORK:** If you aren't 100% sure the brand does something, don't include it in the plan.
4. **BRAND HONESTY:** It is better to have a shorter, more focused plan than one filled with "creative" guesses that are factually incorrect.

If an article title or keyword implies a capability the brand does not clearly have, the plan is invalid.


## FEATURE LIMIT (MANDATORY CONSTRAINT)

You may create AT MOST 4 feature-led articles in the entire 30-day plan.

A "feature-led article" is one where:
- The title mentions a user intent based feature name not a technical term
- The primary purpose is explaining how a specific feature works
- The topic wouldn't exist without this specific product

Examples of feature-led (COUNT TOWARD LIMIT):
- "What is AI Identity-Lock Protocol"
- "How Multi-Ratio Formatting Works"

Examples of market-led (DO NOT COUNT):
- "AI Headshots vs Professional Photography: Cost Breakdown"
- "Why Your LinkedIn Photo Isn't Getting Responses"

If you create more than 4 feature-led articles, the plan is INVALID.

---

## THE 4 STRATEGIC CATEGORIES (TARGET DISTRIBUTION: ~12 + ~8 + ~6 + ~4 = 30)

Aim for this distribution, but prioritize QUALITY over exact counts:

${categorySection}

If you have strong ideas that don't fit the exact count, adjust slightly. Quality > rigid quotas.

---

## ANTI-CANNIBALIZATION RULES (CRITICAL)

Each article must answer a DIFFERENT **intent cluster**. Similar wordings that address the SAME user concern = DUPLICATION.

**THE INTENT CLUSTER TEST:**
Before adding an article, ask: "What is the user's CORE CONCERN?"
- If two articles address the same core concern, they are duplicates—even if titles differ.

**COMMON DUPLICATION TRAPS (AVOID THESE):**

These are the SAME intent cluster → **PICK ONE, cover others as H2 sections:**
- "Is [Product] trustworthy?" = "Is [Product] legit?" = "Can I trust [Product]?" = "Is [Product] safe?"
- "How to get started with [Product]" = "Getting started guide" = "Beginner's tutorial" = "First steps"
- "Best settings for [Product]" = "Optimal configuration" = "How to set up [Product]"
- "[Product] vs [Competitor]" articles should NOT repeat with different framings of same comparison

**VALID DIFFERENT INTENT CLUSTERS:**
| Intent Cluster | What Makes It Unique |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "What is this?" | Foundational definition |
| "Is it worth it?" | Value/cost decision |
| "How do I use it?" | Usage tutorial |
| "Which one is best?" | Comparison/alternatives |
| "[Persona] specific" | Different audience = different article OK |
| "[Use case] specific" | Different context = different article OK |

**RULE:** You may have multiple persona-specific articles (e.g., "for marketers", "for developers", "for small business") because they are DIFFERENT audiences. But you may NOT have multiple trust/legitimacy articles with different framings.

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate EXACTLY 30 articles distributed as follows (NO EXCEPTIONS):

| Category | Count | REQUIRED article_type |
|----------|-------|----------------------|
| Core Answers | 12 | informational |
| Supporting Articles | 8 | howto |
| Conversion Pages | 6 | commercial |
| Authority Plays | 4 | informational |

**ARTICLE TYPE RULES (MANDATORY - DO NOT IGNORE):**
- Core Answers → article_type MUST be "informational"
- Supporting Articles → article_type MUST be "howto" 
- Conversion Pages → article_type MUST be "commercial"
- Authority Plays → article_type MUST be "informational"

**EXPECTED FINAL DISTRIBUTION:**
- informational: 16 articles (Core + Authority)
- howto: 8 articles (Supporting)
- commercial: 6 articles (Conversion)

If your output has >16 informational articles, YOU HAVE FAILED. Check your work.

For each article provide:
1. title: Compelling blog post title (follow MODERN SEO rules above)
2. main_keyword: Primary target keyword (2-4 words)
3. supporting_keywords: 2-3 related keywords (array) which are user intent keywords
4. article_type: "informational" | "commercial" | "howto" (MUST match category above)
5. cluster: Topic cluster for organization
6. intent_role: The specific intent ("Core Answer", "Problem-Specific", "Comparison", "Decision", "Emotional/Story", "Authority/Edge")
7. article_category: One of "Core Answers", "Supporting Articles", "Conversion Pages", "Authority Plays"
8. parent_question: The ONE fundamental user question this article answers
9. reason: A 1-sentence strategic rationale (WHY this content matters for THIS brand)
10. impact: "High" | "Medium" | "Low" (Strategic importance)
11. priority_score: 0-100 (Based on keyword relevance and business value)

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each article's parent_question must be UNIQUE across the plan.
2. If the brand has multiple features, articles must be distributed across ALL features.
3. You MUST generate EXACTLY 30 articles with the 12-8-6-4 distribution.
4. article_type MUST match the category (see table above). Supporting Articles = howto, Conversion Pages = commercial.
