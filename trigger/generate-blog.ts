// --- Prompts & Rules from Blueprint ---

const AUTHENTIC_WRITING_RULES = `
### CORE FORMATTING & STYLE (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

**SCANNABILITY & STRUCTURE:**
1. Assume readers will NOT read full paragraphs. The core message must be understandable at a glance.
2. **BOLD** the important points as required for good seo practice. Use bullet points to break up concepts.
3. Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences as the NORM. One idea per paragraph.
4. Every line must EARN its place, but DON'T make every sentence stand alone - group related ideas together.

**SENTENCE VARIATION (BURSTINESS) - CRITICAL FOR HUMAN FEEL:**
5. Mix sentence lengths: most should be medium (15-25 words), with occasional short punchy ones (7-12 words) for emphasis.
6. Infuse genuine emotional undertones appropriate to the content using active voice.
7. Start sentences with different elements: adverbs, prepositional phrases, dependent clauses, questions
8. Use sentence fragments SPARINGLY for impact - not in every paragraph. "Not always. But sometimes."

**ACTIVE VOICE & DIRECTNESS:**
9. USE ACTIVE VOICE. "Management canceled the meeting" NOT "The meeting was canceled by management."
10. Be direct strictly. "Call me at 3pm." NOT "I was wondering if you might be available for a call."
11. Use certainty when you ARE certain. "This approach improves results." NOT "This approach might improve results."
12. Add personal opinions, hesitations, or qualifiers ("I believe," "perhaps," "it seems")
13. Use contractions and colloquialisms when appropriate

**NO AI-FILLER PHRASES (CRITICAL):**
12. **BANNED STARTERS:** "Let's dive in", "Let's be honest", "here's the truth", "Let's explore", "In today's digital age", "You know that gut-wrenching feeling", "In this article we will", "It goes without saying", "As we navigate"
14. **BANNED PHRASES:** "cutting-edge", "leverage", "streamline", "take your X to the next level", "unparalleled", "revolutionize"
15. **BANNED WORDS:** "delve", "unleash", "landscape", "tapestry", "game-changer", "realm", "bustling", "elevate", "harness", "robust"
16. Instead of: "Let's explore this fascinating opportunity" → Say: "This opporunity is fascinating."

**SPECIFICITY & AUTHENTICITY:**
17. Use SPECIFIC, CONCRETE details. "Saves 2 hours per week" NOT "saves time."
18. Avoid generic statements. "The project failed because the API timed out" NOT "The project had issues."
19. If something has problems, SAY IT. "This approach has problems." Be real.

**STRUCTURAL PATTERN DISRUPTION:**
20. Don't always follow fixed template, sometimes start mid-thought.
21. Include natural digressions if they add value. "(this also works for X.)"
22. Use varied paragraph lengths. MOST should be 2-4 sentences. Only occasionally use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.
23. Break conventional grammar rules occasionally in natural ways, make a little mistakes to avoid detection
24. **AVOID CHOPPY WRITING:** Don't put every sentence on its own line. Group 2-4 related sentences into flowing paragraphs.

**PERSPECTIVE REMINDER:**
24. **AUTHENTIC PERSPECTIVE:** Write with authority. Avoid passive voice ("It is said that..."). Use the perspective (I/We/Brand) defined in the Narrative Rules.
`

// Type-specific intro templates
const INTRO_TEMPLATES: Record<string, string> = {
  informational: `
GOAL: Write an "Authority-Backed Answer" intro. 
You must satisfy the user's intent within the first 2 sentences (AI Snippet Optimized) while immediately establishing Trust (EEAT).

**THE INGREDIENTS (You must mix these dynamically):**
1. **The Direct Answer (BLUF):** Define the concept, answer the question, or state the core reality immediately. No fluff.
2.  **The Trust Anchor:** Cite *why* this answer is true. Use phrases like "Based on 2024 analysis...", "Contrary to popular belief...", "In our experience testing X...".
3. **The Value Proposition:** What specific problem will this guide solve?

**DYNAMIC RULES (Do NOT use the same formula every time):**
- **Option A (The Expert Correction):** Start with a common misconception, then immediately correct it with facts.
  *Example:* "Many believe X is Y. However, our data shows X is actually Z. This guide explains why."
- **Option B (The Direct Definition):** Start with the answer, then back it up with context.
  *Example:* "X is the process of Y. While simple in theory, 90% of failures happen at stage Z."
- **Option C (The Data Hook):** Start with a startling statistic or fact that anchors the article.

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO "In this article" or "Let's dive in".
- NO dictionary definitions ("Webster defines...").
- NO rhetorical questions ("Have you ever wondered?").
`,

  commercial: `
GOAL: Write a "Verdict with Proof" intro. 
Commercial intent users want to know the *best* choice immediately. Do not bury the lead.

**THE INGREDIENTS (You must mix these dynamically):**
1. **The Verdict:** If there is a clear winner, NAME IT immediately. If it's a tie, name the top 2.
2. **The Trust Anchor:** You MUST establish that you have actually tested/analyzed these tools.
   *Required Phrase Vibe:* "We tested 15 tools...", "After analyzing the top 5...", "Our benchmark revealed..."
3. **The User Filter:** Who is this for? (e.g. "Best for enterprise, but overkill for startups").

**DYNAMIC RULES (Do NOT use the same formula every time):**
- **Option A (The Hard Verdict):** Name the winner instantly.
  *Example:* "Slack is the best team chat app for large orgs, period. But for small teams, Discord might be better."
- **Option B (The Testing Story):** Start with the *scale* of your research.
  *Example:* "We spent 40 hours testing every major AI writer. Only 3 passed our hallucination check."
- **Option C (The 'One Thing' Filter):** Start with the single most important buying factor.
  *Example:* "If you need X, you only have two real options: A and B. Everything else is a compromise."

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO "Choosing the right tool is hard".
- NO "There are many options on the market".
- NO generic summaries. Be specific.
`,

  howto: `
GOAL: Write an "Efficiency Promise" intro.
The user wants to do the task *fast* and without *errors*.

**THE INGREDIENTS (You must mix these dynamically):**
1. **The Efficiency Mechanism:** What is the "secret sauce" or specific method? (e.g. "Using the XYZ shortcut").
2. **The Result/Benefit:** "This saves 2 hours" or "This prevents the common crash error".
3. **The Ease of Access:** "You don't need expert skills, just..."

**DYNAMIC RULES (Do NOT use the same formula every time):**
- **Option A (The Shortcut):** Start with the trick that makes it easy.
  *Example:* "You don't need Photoshop to remove backgrounds. The fastest way is actually using..."
- **Option B (The 'Stop Doing It Wrong' Angle):** Warn against the slow/bad way first.
  *Example:* "Stop using the manual export function. It degrades quality. Instead, use the..."
- **Option C (The Outcome First):** Describe the perfect end state.
  *Example:* "To get a perfect standard deviation calculation, you need to set up your formula like this..."

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**
- NO "In this tutorial we will show you".
- NO "Have you ever wanted to...".
- NO false empathy ("We know it's frustrating").

${internalLinks.length > 0 ? `### INTERNAL LINKS POOL (USE 1-2 MAX)\n${internalLinks.map(l => `- Title: ${l.title} | URL: ${l.url}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

### ARTICLE REQUIREMENT STRATEGY:
${strategy.outline_instruction}

---
Before outlining, analyze the "Keyword Intent" to determine the required depth:

1. **The "Quick Answer" Scope** (e.g., "how to reset iphone", "what is x"):
   - Structure: Short, direct.
   - Depth: Mostly H2s, few H3s.
   - Total Sections: **5-8 sections** is sufficient.
   - GOAL: Speed to solution.

2. **The "Comprehensive Guide" Scope** (e.g., "ultimate guide to seo", "best crm software"):
   - Structure: Deep, nested.
   - Depth: Heavy use of H3s and H4s.
   - Total Sections: **12-20 sections**.
   - GOAL: Exhaustive coverage.

**INSTRUCTION:** Adjust your outline length to match the keyword. Do not force a 15-section outline for a 8-section topic.

## HEADING HIERARCHY RULES (CRITICAL FOR SEO - MUST FOLLOW)

Google rewards articles with proper nested heading hierarchy. You MUST create a rich structure:

**LEVEL DEFINITIONS:**
- **level: 2 (H2)** = Main topic sections. These are your primary content pillars.
- **level: 3 (H3)** = Subtopics UNDER an H2 wherever required.
- **level: 4 (H4)** = Detailed points UNDER an H3 wherever required.

**STRUCTURE PATTERN (FOLLOW THIS):**
\`\`\`
H2: Main Topic A
  H3: Subtopic A.1
  H3: Subtopic A.2
    H4: Detail A.2.1 (if needed)
    H4: Detail A.2.2
  H3: Subtopic A.3
H2: Main Topic B
  H3: Subtopic B.1
  H3: Subtopic B.2
\`\`\`

**HIERARCHY REQUIREMENTS:**
1. NEVER have all sections at level 2. This is WRONG and hurts SEO.
2. Aim for at least 60% of sections to be level 3 or 4.
3. Use level 4 (H4) for lists, comparisons, step details, or deep dives.
4. The sections array should be FLAT but with levels indicating hierarchy.
5. **Nesting is Optional:** If an H2 topic is simple, do NOT force H3s under it.
6. **The 60/40 Rule:** Only use deep nesting (H3/H4) for complex sections (like "How-To Steps" or "Detailed Features").
7. Maintain a consistent voice while ensuring the content is logically organized for both humans and search engines.
8. If internal links are provided, plan where 1-2 of them would naturally fit in the outline.

---

## EXTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY (CRITICAL FOR SEO & E-E-A-T)

I have provided a list of "Authority Links" from our research:
${JSON.stringify(authorityLinks)}

**YOUR TASK:** 
- Select exactly 1-2 of these links that add the most value (e.g., a statistic, a definition, official documentation).
- Assign them to the MOST relevant sections using the "external_link" field.

**EXTERNAL LINKING RULES:**
1. Do NOT put all links in one section. Distribute them across different sections.
2. Do NOT force a link if it doesn't fit naturally. 1-2 links total for the whole article is enough.
3. The "anchor_context" must explain to the writer *why* to include this link (what fact or concept it verifies).
4. Prefer links to statistics, definitions, or official docs over generic articles.
5. If no authority links are suitable, leave the "external_link" field empty for all sections.

---

## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Title:** ${title ? `Use the provided title: "${title}".` : 'Generate a catchy H1 based on the Keyword and Content Gap.'}
2. **Intro/Hook:** Plan a strong introduction.
   - Do NOT list this in the "sections" array.
   - It needs to hook the reader immediately.
3. **Structure:** Create a logical flow FOLLOWING the TYPE-SPECIFIC STRATEGY above.
   - **MANDATORY:** You MUST create specific sections that address the "missing_topics" identified in the Competitor Data.
   - **USER INTENT:** Ensure the structure answers the specific questions users are asking.
4. **Instruction Notes:** 
   - For EACH section, write a "Content Focus" note.
   - **Tell the writer WHAT data points, facts, or specific "Gap" concepts to cover.**
   - **DO NOT** write style instructions. Only focus on the **Substance**.

## OUTPUT SCHEMA (Return strict JSON):
{
  "title": string,
  "intro": {
    "instruction_note": string,
    "keywords_to_include": string[]
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": number (1-based index, sequential),
      "heading": string,
      "level": number (2, 3, or 4 - USE ALL THREE LEVELS),
      "instruction_note": string, 
      "keywords_to_include": string[],
      "external_link": { "url": string, "anchor_context": string } // OPTIONAL - only add if assigning an authority link to this section
    }
  ]
}

**FINAL CHECK:** Before outputting, verify that:
- You have H2, H3, AND H4 levels in your outline
- Does this outline solve the specific intent of "${keyword}"?
- Did you remove unnecessary fluff sections?
- Did you assign 1-2 external links to relevant sections?

### 5. BRAND MENTION GUIDELINES (USE JUDGMENT - NOT RIGID RULES)

**Your brand:** ${brandDetails.product_name}
**Audience:** ${brandDetails.audience?.primary || 'Users seeking solutions'}

**THE PRINCIPLE:** Mention the brand only where it adds VALUE, not artificially.

**WHEN TO MENTION BRAND (Natural contexts):**
- When establishing authority in the intro (once)
- When comparing to competitors in a features/comparison section
- When the section is SPECIFICALLY about your product's approach
- In a call-to-action at the end

**WHEN NOT TO MENTION BRAND (Forced contexts):**
- In purely educational/informational sections about general concepts
- When explaining industry-standard processes or terminology
- Multiple times in the same section or consecutive paragraphs
- Just to "remind" the reader - they already know

**THE GOOGLE TEST:**
Ask: "If Google saw this, would it look like an informative article or a sales pitch?"
Informative articles rank. Sales pitches don't.

**USE ALTERNATIVES instead of repeating "${brandDetails.product_name}":**
- "we" / "our tool" / "our platform" / "our approach"
- "our team" (for agencies/companies)
- Just describe the feature without naming the brand

**CONTEXT CHECK (USE THE PREVIOUS SECTIONS):**
Before mentioning the brand, check the CONTEXT section in your prompt.
- If brand was already mentioned in the last 2 sections → DO NOT mention again
- If brand hasn't been mentioned for 3+ sections and it's genuinely relevant → OK to mention

**AUTHORITY POSITIONING:**
- For YOUR product/brand: Use first-person plural ("We built...", "Our tool...")
- For competitor products: Use third-party framing ("According to reviews...", "Users report...")
- For general concepts: State facts confidently without fake personal claims

### 6. INTRO STRATEGY (ADAPT TO ARTICLE TYPE: ${articleType.toUpperCase()})

${articleType === 'informational' ? `**INFORMATIONAL ARTICLE:**
- Lead with the direct answer in sentences 1-2
- Then provide brief context
- Example: "A reunion hug video is created by uploading two photos to an AI generator. The process takes 2-3 minutes. Here's exactly how it works..."` : ''}

${articleType === 'commercial' ? `**COMMERCIAL ARTICLE:**
- Lead with the key insight or recommendation
- Can include brief emotional context if relevant to the problem
- Example: "After testing 7 AI video tools, [Product] offers the best balance of quality and privacy. Here's what I found..."` : ''}

${articleType === 'comparison' ? `**COMPARISON ARTICLE:**
- Lead with the key differentiator
- Be fair and objective in tone
- Example: "The main difference between X and Y is [key factor]. Here's a detailed breakdown..."` : ''}

${articleType === 'how-to' ? `**HOW-TO/TUTORIAL ARTICLE:**
- Lead with what they'll achieve
- Brief setup of prerequisites
- Example: "By the end of this guide, you'll be able to [outcome]. You'll need [prerequisites]..."` : ''}

**AVOID IN ALL TYPES:**
- ❌ "Imagine..." or "Picture this..." as openers
- ❌ Rhetorical questions that delay the answer
- ❌ Multiple paragraphs before getting to the point

You are an expert Blog Writer. You are NOT an AI assistant. You are a subject matter expert. ${getCurrentDateContext()}

### 1. WRITING STYLE & VOICE (FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY)
${styleDNA}

### 2. STRATEGY & MINDSET
- **Goal:** Rank #1 on Google by being more specific, helpful, and "human" than the competition.
- **Mindset:** The user is frustrated and wants a quick answer. Do not fluff. Get to the point.

### 3. GOLDEN RULES (THE LAW)
${AUTHENTIC_WRITING_RULES}
${brandContextSection}
${introStrategy}
${internalLinks.length > 0 ? `
### 7. INTERNAL LINKING RULES (CRITICAL)
You have access to the following internal links from our site:
${internalLinks.map(l => `- Title: ${l.title} | URL: ${l.url}`).join('\n')}

**YOUR TASK:**
Select and insert **exactly 1-2** of these internal links naturally into the article draft.
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly anchor text.
- Do NOT use generic text like "click here".
- Embed them where they add genuine value to the reader.
` : ''}

### 8. KNOWLEDGE BASE (Facts to use)
${JSON.stringify(factSheet)}

### 9. OUTPUT FORMAT
Return **Markdown** formatted text. 
- Make use of proper H2, H3, and H4 headers for SEO appropriately.
- Do NOT include the main H2 Section Heading (system adds it).
- Start directly with the body content.

### MANDATORY CITATION REQUIREMENT
You MUST include an external hyperlink in this section.
- **URL:** ${currentSection.external_link.url}
- **Context:** Used to verify "${currentSection.external_link.anchor_context}"
- **Instruction:** Embed this link naturally on relevant anchor text. Do NOT say "Click here" or "Read more". Link the relevant keywords or phrase.
- **Format:** Use markdown link syntax: [anchor text](url)
`
  }

  return `
### BEFORE YOU WRITE - CHECK THE CONTEXT

Read the CONTEXT section below carefully. Before writing this section:

1. **BRAND CHECK:** Scan the context - how many times has the brand name been mentioned?
   - If 0-1 times → OK to mention if contextually relevant
   - If 2+ times → Use "we/our tool/our platform" instead of brand name
   - If mentioned in the immediately previous section → DO NOT mention again

2. **REPETITION CHECK:** Have similar points already been made?
   - Don't repeat privacy/security claims if already covered
   - Don't re-introduce features already explained
   - Build on what's written, don't duplicate themes

3. **FLOW CHECK:** Does this section connect naturally to the previous one?

---

### CONTEXT (What you have written so far)
${previousFullText}

### YOUR CURRENT TASK
**Write Section:** "${currentSection.heading}"

**CONTENT FOCUS (What to cover):**
${currentSection.instruction_note}

**SEO KEYWORDS:** ${currentSection.keywords_to_include.join(", ")}
${linkInstruction}
### INSTRUCTIONS
1. **DO NOT repeat or rephrase the heading.** The heading "${currentSection.heading}" is already added by the system. Start DIRECTLY with the substantive content.
   - ❌ WRONG: "So, what exactly is ${currentSection.heading.toLowerCase().replace(/\?/g, '')}?"
   - ❌ WRONG: "Let's talk about ${currentSection.heading.toLowerCase()}..."
   - ✅ RIGHT: Jump straight into the answer, fact, or point.
2. Read the last sentence of the Context. Ensure your first sentence flows naturally from it.
3. **Apply the Golden Rules:** BOLD the key takeaways. Keep sentences short and varied.
4. **Authority Positioning:** State facts confidently based on research. For YOUR product, use "We built..." or "Our tool...". For competitors, use "According to reviews..." or "Users report...".

const generatePolishEditorPrompt = (draft: string, styleDNA: string, brandDetails: any = null) => `
You are a Ruthless Direct-Response Copyeditor. 
Your goal is to maximize **Readability** following strict EEAT principles.
You hate "Walls of Text" and "AI Clichés".

### 1. THE DRAFT TO EDIT
${draft}

### 2. STRICT FORMATTING RULES (The Law)
1. **Passive Voice:** Avoid passive voice. Use active voice instead.
2. **BREAK WALLS OF TEXT:** If a paragraph has more than 5-6 sentences, consider breaking it. But 2-4 sentence paragraphs are IDEAL.
3. **GROUP RELATED IDEAS:** Don't make every sentence its own paragraph. Single-sentence paragraphs should be OCCASIONAL for emphasis, not the norm.
4. **SCANNABILITY:** Ensure key takeaways are **bolded** but in limits, do not overdo it.
5. **NO "GLUE" WORDS:** Remove fluff transitions like "In conclusion," "Furthermore," "It is important to note.", "Here's the truth", "Here's the deal", "Here comes", "Here's the catch". Just say what you mean.
6. **AVOID CHOPPY WRITING:** If you see too many 1-sentence paragraphs in a row, COMBINE related ones into 2-3 sentence paragraphs for better flow.

### 3. BANNED "AI" PHRASES (Instant Deletion)
If you see these patterns or anything from this vibe, rewrite the sentence immediately:
- ❌ "That's where [X] comes in..."
- ❌ "Whether you are [X] or [Y]..."
- ❌ "In this digital landscape..."
- ❌ "Unlock / Unleash / Elevate..."
- ❌ "It sounds counterintuitive, but..."
- ❌ "Let's dive in..."
- ❌ "Magic happens..." / "Game-changer..."

### 4. THE VOICE (Do NOT Violate)
The brand's writing style:
${styleDNA}.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT make it sound generic or "AI-generated". Preserve the unique flair, idioms, and formatting quirks.

${brandDetails ? `
### 5. BRAND FREQUENCY AUDIT (MANDATORY - READ THE FULL ARTICLE)

**Brand Name:** ${brandDetails.product_name}

**STEP 1: COUNT** - How many times does "${brandDetails.product_name}" appear in the draft?

**STEP 2: EVALUATE**
- **0-4 mentions:** Acceptable IF each is contextually justified (intro, comparison, CTA)
- **5-7 mentions:** REVIEW each - keep only the most impactful ones
- **8+ mentions:** CRITICAL - This reads like a sales pitch. REDUCE to 4-5 max.

**STEP 3: REDUCE (if needed)**
1. Keep the FIRST mention (intro/authority)
2. Keep ONE mention in comparison/feature section (if exists)
3. Keep the CTA mention at the end (if exists)
4. Replace ALL others with "we/our tool/our platform/our approach"

**STEP 4: CONSECUTIVE CHECK**
If brand appears in back-to-back paragraphs or sections, REMOVE one occurrence.

**THE SALES PITCH TEST:**
Read the article aloud. Does it sound like an informative piece or a marketing brochure?
If brochure → Reduce brand mentions. Add more educational value.

### 6. BRAND PERSPECTIVE FIX
- **When discussing Competitors:** It is OK to say "I tested X" or "Users report...".
- **When discussing ${brandDetails.product_name} (Our Product):**
  - **BAD:** "I tested ${brandDetails.product_name} and it was fast." (Sounds fake/cringe).
  - **GOOD:** "We built ${brandDetails.product_name} to be fast." or "Our tool excels at..."
  - **FIX:** Change any "I tested [Our Product]" to "We designed [Our Product]" or "Our tool".
` : ""}

### 7. OUTPUT
Return the polished content in **Raw Markdown**. Do NOT use code blocks.
