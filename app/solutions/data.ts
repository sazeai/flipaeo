            answer: 'Perplexity Optimization is the process of structuring your website so that Perplexity AI trusts and quotes your brand in its answers. Unlike Google, which ranks pages based heavily on backlinks, Perplexity uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This means it actively searches the web for the most factual, up-to-date, and easy-to-read answers, synthesizes them, and provides clickable citations. To win, you must shift from "keyword stuffing" to providing dense, well-formatted facts.',

Both channels matter. Training data shapes the LLM\'s baseline understanding, while retrieval data can override or supplement it. Effective LLM Brand Optimization must address both channels.' },
                { heading: 'The Narrative Engineering Framework', content: 'Narrative Engineering is the process of strategically creating content that shapes how LLMs describe your brand. It involves: (1) Defining your ideal AI narrative, (2) Auditing the current AI narrative, (3) Identifying narrative gaps and inaccuracies, (4) Creating authoritative content to fill gaps and correct inaccuracies, and (5) Monitoring and maintaining the narrative over time.' },
                { heading: 'Competitive Narrative Defense', content: 'In the AI search era, your competitors can influence how AI engines describe you. When a competitor publishes a biased comparison, case study, or review, AI engines may absorb and reproduce that narrative. Proactive LLM Brand Optimization includes monitoring competitive content and deploying counter-narratives that establish your brand\'s authoritative version of the story.' },
                { heading: 'The ROI of AI Brand Management', content: 'AI engines are increasingly the first touchpoint in purchase research. When a potential customer asks ChatGPT about your category, the AI\'s response shapes their perception before they even visit your website. Brands that invest in LLM Brand Optimization control this critical first impression, leading to higher conversion rates, better qualified leads, and stronger competitive positioning.' }

            { question: 'Can I control what AI engines say about my brand?', answer: 'You can\'t directly edit AI responses, but you can heavily influence them. By creating authoritative, consistent, well-structured content about your brand, you shape the source material that AI engines use to form and update their "understanding" of your brand.' },
            { question: 'How quickly can I change my AI brand narrative?', answer: 'RAG-based responses (where AI browses the web) can be influenced within weeks of publishing new content. Training data-based responses take longer — typically 3-6 months as models retrain. FlipAEO targets both channels for comprehensive narrative control.' },
            { question: 'Is LLM Brand Optimization different from PR or reputation management?', answer: 'It shares goals with PR but uses different tactics. Traditional PR targets journalists and publications. LLM Brand Optimization targets AI retrieval systems with structured, entity-rich content specifically formatted for machine comprehension and citation.' },
            { question: 'What if AI engines are saying negative things about my brand?', answer: 'FlipAEO conducts a thorough AI perception audit and then deploys counter-narrative content that provides accurate, positive, authoritative information. Over time, the volume and authority of positive content outweighs negative signals in AI responses.' }
